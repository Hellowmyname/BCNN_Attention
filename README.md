# Histopathological Tissue Segmentation of Lung Cancer with Bilinear CNN and Soft Attention
https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7966553

Automatic tissue segmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is a critical task in hematoxylin and eosin- (H&E-) stained histopathological images for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of lung cancer. Patch classification and stitching the classification results can fast conduct tissue segmentation of WSIs. However, due to the tumour heterogeneity, large intraclass variability and small interclass variability make the classification task challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel bilinear convolutional neural network- (Bilinear-CNN-) based model with a bilinear convolutional module and a soft attention module to tackle this problem. This method investigates the intraclass semantic correspondence and focuses on the more distinguishable features that make feature output variations relatively large between interclass. The performance of the Bilinear-CNN-based model is compared with other state-of-the-art methods on the histopathological classification dataset, which consists of 107.7 k patches of lung cancer. We further evaluate our proposed algorithm on an additional dataset from colorectal cancer. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to that of previous state-of-the-art ones and the interpretability of our proposed method is demonstrated by Grad-CAM.
